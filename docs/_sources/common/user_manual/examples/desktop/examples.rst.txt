The examples in this section can be accessed from the application by selecting Examples in the Main Menu. They demonstrate the range of workflows that can be executed with the application and serve as ready-to-use **prototypes** that may be modified to create custom workflows. Each example is designed to run quickly, with the primary goal of demonstrating how workflows can be assembled. To achieve this, certain settings—such as the number of samples, the finite element model, and the number of assets—have been intentionally kept small and simplified.

.. only:: PBE_app

   The following are a few examples showing the usage of PBE. The files for the examples are available on GitHub. The scope of these examples is limited to damage and loss assessment. The usage of the tool for response estimation is identical to that of the EE-UQ application. Examples of those features are available in the `EE-UQ Documentation <https://nheri-simcenter.github.io/EE-UQ-Documentation/common/user_manual/examples/desktop/examples.html>`_.

   All examples come with input files that are available in the `PBE GitHub repository <https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/PBE/tree/master/Examples>`_.	  

.. only:: PBE1_app

   The following examples demonstrate the usage of the PBE application. The scope of these examples is limited to damage and loss assessment. The usage of the tool for response estimation is identical to that of the EE-UQ application. Examples of those features are available in the `EE-UQ Documentation <https://nheri-simcenter.github.io/EE-UQ-Documentation/common/user_manual/examples/desktop/examples.html>`_.
